          <p><span data-caps="initial">&#8220;W</span><small>E DON&#8217;T HAVE</small> anything left,&#8221; says Julio Balico García, a farmer from Río Viejo, a village in Honduras&#8217;s Atlántida department on the country&#8217;s Caribbean coast. When a tropical storm called Sara hit Central America in mid-November, his concrete house was washed away. Only one jagged wall remains.</p><p>The storm wreaked havoc nationwide, leaving six dead and displacing over 6,000 people across Honduras. It was far from the most damaging storm to have hit the country; Hurricane Mitch killed 7,000 Hondurans in 1998. But Sara highlights even more starkly the extent to which the governments of Honduras and the countries around it are unprepared for a warmer future, with more damaging storms smashing their way out of the Gulf of Mexico more often than before. Without better adaptation, storms like Sara and other extremes of weather could reduce Honduras&#8217;s <small>GDP</small> by 5.4% by 2050, according to the World Bank. Further climate change may push the costs even higher.</p><h3>Storm-shocked</h3><p>Weeks after Sara made landfall, Honduras remains on an emergency footing. At least 11 bridges have been destroyed, cutting off 2,500 villages. &#8220;We should not still be in emergency mode,&#8221; says Edgardo Amaya, head of the Municipal Emergency Committee in La Ceiba, a port city that is Atlántida&#8217;s capital. Though tropical storms are common in the region&#8212;Honduras recorded 18 of them as well as 16 hurricanes this season&#8212;they continue to take the authorities by surprise, hitting ever harder and more widely. &#8220;No one is fully prepared,&#8221; says Darwin Cantarero from the Permanent Contingencies Commission in Colón, one of the worst-hit departments.</p><p>Honduras and its Central American neighbours are doing very little in terms of long-term planning for climate-risk mitigation and adaptation; and few risks loom larger than the increased intensity and frequency of storms as the world warms. Instead, held back by high levels of crime, political corruption, mass emigration and deep poverty&#8212;in the Western hemisphere only desolate Haiti is poorer&#8212;Honduras lurches from one emergency to the next.</p><p>When destroyed infrastructure is rebuilt, it is often done without ensuring that it can survive the next storm. In La Ceiba locals are stuck in traffic because Sara split one of the city&#8217;s two main bridges in half; the same bridge had been destroyed by previous hurricanes, in 2020. &#8220;Had the project been designed with climate change in mind&#8230;the lifetime cost would have been much lower than the total cost with reconstruction,&#8221; says Eduardo González, a climate-change expert at the Central American Bank for Economic Integration.</p><p>Treating climate disasters on an event-by-event basis is economic nonsense. Politicians in the cash-strapped country may think they cannot afford to adapt to climate change, but what Honduras truly cannot afford are the recurrent setbacks as a result of failing to invest in resilient infrastructure. The World Bank has estimated that such resilience would cost 3% more upfront but would reap returns of $4 for every $1 spent. The need for adaptation will become clearer and more urgent as extreme-weather events become more powerful and frequent.</p><p>The effects of inadequate climate adaptation could reach beyond Honduras and Central America. A devastated agricultural sector might cause regional food prices to soar. Supply chains may be disrupted. And climate refugees will increase. Between 2000 and 2020 the rate of Hondurans emigrating doubled. The first wave was caused by Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which resulted losses equivalent to 60-70% of annual <small>GDP</small> and led the United States to grant &#8220;temporary protected status&#8221; to fleeing Hondurans. One study suggests that hurricanes in Central America and the Caribbean already spur emigration to the United States that is about 6% higher on average than it would otherwise be.</p><p>Sara is part of a worrying pattern of intensifying climate events across the region. Storms bring more rainfall than they used to, and droughts are even more severe. Climate change makes oceans hotter, which in turn makes the storms that form over the water even fiercer, points out Diego Obando Bonilla, a climate professor at Zamorano University. According to the World Meteorological Organisation, a <small>UN</small> agency, 2023 was a record year for climate-related hazards in Latin America and the Caribbean, resulting in extreme heat, hurricanes and droughts.</p><h3>Wake up, dozy leaders</h3><p>Honduras seems to be less prepared every time a climate disaster strikes. The impact compounds, leaving the country more vulnerable with each storm. Solutions are available but are rarely implemented. Honduras needs better territorial planning, particularly to avoid construction in high-risk areas. Commercial farmers should invest in new technologies and practices to improve water management. They should also use sustainable materials and conserve or plant trees that can act as shock-absorbers when extreme weather inevitably arrives.</p><p class="end has-stop">The country&#8217;s political leaders have yet to learn these lessons. Foreign governments, development banks and <small>NGO</small>s are focusing more on climate adaptation, but they alone cannot make Honduras better prepared. Some of the country&#8217;s officials, meanwhile, simply cling to faith. &#8220;It&#8217;s in God&#8217;s hands,&#8221; says Colón&#8217;s governor. </p>
